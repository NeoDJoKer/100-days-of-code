# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jo

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 4, Wednesday, 2017].

## Log
 
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on an Election code where it records the number of vote for each party.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
